# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The dashboard's user experience should prioritize **clarity, efficiency, and utility**. It is a professional tool for developers, so the design should be clean, data-dense, and predictable. The primary goal is to empower users to manage their projects quickly and confidently with minimal friction.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The interface will follow established dashboard conventions:

  * A persistent left-hand navigation menu for major sections.
  * A main content area for displaying data tables, forms, and lists.
  * Modal dialogs for critical actions like creation or confirmation.
  * Clear breadcrumbs for easy navigation within nested views.

## Core Screens and Views

Conceptually, the MVP will require the following primary screens:

  * **Login/Connect Wallet Screen**: A simple page to connect a Solana wallet.
  * **Projects Dashboard**: The main landing page after login, listing all of the user's projects.
  * **Project View**: A detailed view for a single project, acting as a container for managing its users, resources, and characters.
  * **Resource Management Page**: An interface to view, create, and mint resources.
  * **Character Model Page**: An interface to view and create new character models.

## Accessibility

  * **Standard**: WCAG AA

## Branding

  * The initial design will use a clean, professional, and neutral "developer tool" aesthetic. If a specific brand guide or color palette for Honeycomb Protocol exists, it should be provided.

## Target Device and Platforms

  * Web Responsive
