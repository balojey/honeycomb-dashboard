# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Increase the adoption and retention of the Honeycomb Protocol.
* Reduce the time-to-market for developers building with Honeycomb.
* Enable developers to create a project, define a resource, and mint it in under 5 minutes.
* Decrease the volume of API-related support questions.

## Background Context
Honeycomb Protocol provides a powerful GraphQL API to simplify Web3 game development on Solana. However, developers currently lack a graphical interface for managing their projects, requiring them to build their own admin panels or interact directly with the API. This project will create the **Honeycomb Protocol Dashboard (or Hive Control)** to provide a user-friendly, web-based GUI. This will lower the barrier to entry, streamline project management, and accelerate development for game developers using the protocol.
