# Security and Performance

  * **Security:** A strict Content Security Policy (CSP), rate limiting on the BFF, input validation, and secure token handling.
  * **Performance:** Focus on small bundle sizes via Vite's code-splitting, backend performance via the Bun/Hono stack, and frontend perceived performance via skeleton screens.
