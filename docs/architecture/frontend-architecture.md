# Frontend Architecture

  * **Component Organization:** A feature-based directory structure (`src/features/...`).
  * **State Management:** Zustand for global state, React Hooks for local state.
  * **Routing:** `react-router-dom` with a centralized route configuration.
  * **Services:** A dedicated service layer for all API communication.
