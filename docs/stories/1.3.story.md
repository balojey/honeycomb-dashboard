# Story 1.3: Display Project List

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** to see a list of all my Honeycomb projects after I connect my wallet, **so that** I can get an immediate overview of my assets.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [cite_start]Upon successful wallet connection, the application makes a call to the BFF, which then queries the Honeycomb API's `project` endpoint, using the public key from the connected wallet as the `authority`[cite: 1483].
2. [cite_start]If the API call is successful, the dashboard displays a list of projects, showing at least the project name[cite: 1483].
3. [cite_start]If the user has no projects, a message is displayed indicating "No projects found"[cite: 1483].
4. [cite_start]If the API call fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed[cite: 1483].

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Backend (BFF):**
    - [x] Create the Hono route handler for `GET /api/projects`.
    - [x] Implement the handler to call the `Honeycomb API Client` service.
    - [x] The service method should use the `edge-client` to fetch projects for the user's public key.
    - [x] Ensure the endpoint returns the project data or a standardized error.
- [x] **Frontend (Service Layer):**
    - [x] Create a `projectService.ts` file to handle communication with the BFF.
    - [x] Implement a `fetchProjects` function that calls the `GET /api/projects` endpoint.
- [x] **Frontend (State Management):**
    - [x] Create a `projectStore.ts` using Zustand.
    - [x] Add state variables for `projects`, `isLoading`, and `error`.
    - [x] Create an action that uses the `projectService` to fetch projects and update the store's state.
- [x] **Frontend (UI Component):**
    - [x] Create a `ProjectList.tsx` React component.
    - [x] The component should subscribe to the `projectStore`.
    - [x] It must correctly render the UI for loading, error, and empty states.
    - [x] When projects are available, it must render them in a list or table format.

### Dev Notes
The developer agent must have access to the public key of the connected wallet to pass to the BFF. The BFF will then use this key as the `authority` when querying the Honeycomb API.

#### How to Interact with the Honeycomb Protocol
All on-chain interactions must follow this two-step pattern using the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`.

**1. Prepare the Transaction**
Use the client to call the appropriate method for creating a transaction. This returns a serialized transaction response.

*Example*:
```ts
const {
  createCreateProjectTransaction: { tx: txResponse },
} = await client.createCreateProjectTransaction({
  name: "My Project",
  authority: authorityPublicKey,
});
```

**2. Sign and Send the Transaction**
Use the `sendClientTransactions` helper function to prompt the user to sign and then send the transaction.

*Example*:

```ts
import { sendClientTransactions } from "@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client/client/walletHelpers";

const response = await sendClientTransactions(client, wallet, txResponse);
```

While this story only involves fetching data, this pattern is mandatory for future stories that perform "write" actions.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)
### Review Type: Pre-Implementation Story Review

### Story Quality Assessment
The story is well-defined with clear, testable acceptance criteria and a logical breakdown of tasks. The separation of concerns between the BFF, frontend services, state, and UI is excellent. The Dev Notes provide crucial context for implementation.

### Test Plan & Quality Guidance
The following tests are required to ensure quality. The developer should implement these as part of the story completion.

#### 1. Unit Tests
- **`ProjectList.tsx` (UI Component)**
  - [ ] Should render a loading state (e.g., spinner) when `isLoading` is `true`.
  - [ ] Should render an error message when `error` is not null.
  - [ ] Should render a "No projects found" message when `projects` is an empty array.
  - [ ] Should render a list of project names when `projects` contains data.
  - [ ] Should match snapshot tests for all states (loading, error, empty, data).
- **`projectStore.ts` (Zustand Store)**
  - [ ] Should have the correct initial state (`projects: [], isLoading: true, error: null`).
  - [ ] Action `fetchProjects` should set `isLoading` to `true` immediately.
  - [ ] On successful API response, action should update `projects` with data, set `isLoading` to `false`, and `error` to `null`.
  - [ ] On failed API response, action should update `error` with an error message, set `isLoading` to `false`, and `projects` to an empty array.
- **`projectService.ts` (Frontend Service)**
  - [ ] `fetchProjects` should correctly call the `GET /api/projects` endpoint.
  - [ ] `fetchProjects` should handle a successful (2xx) response and return the data.
  - [ ] `fetchProjects` should handle non-successful (4xx, 5xx) responses and throw a standardized error.
- **BFF `GET /api/projects` Handler**
  - [ ] Should correctly extract the `authority` public key from the request context/session.
  - [ ] Should call the `Honeycomb API Client` with the correct `authority`.
  - [ ] Should return a 200 status with project data on success.
  - [ ] Should return a 401/403 status if the user is not authenticated.
  - [ ] Should return a 500 status with a standardized error message if the upstream Honeycomb API call fails.

#### 2. Integration Tests
- **Frontend <-> BFF**
  - [ ] A test verifying that the `ProjectList` component, when rendered, successfully triggers the fetch chain and displays mock data returned from a live (test-instance) BFF endpoint.
- **BFF <-> Honeycomb API**
  - [ ] A test for the BFF service verifying it can successfully connect to and parse a response from a mocked Honeycomb API `project` endpoint.

#### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Happy Path (User has projects)**
  - [ ] Test simulates wallet connection, intercepts the API call to return mock project data, and asserts that the project list is rendered correctly.
- **Empty State (User has no projects)**
  - [ ] Test simulates wallet connection, intercepts the API call to return an empty array, and asserts that the "No projects found" message is displayed.
- **Error State (API fails)**
  - [ ] Test simulates wallet connection, intercepts the API call to return a 500 error, and asserts that a user-friendly error message is displayed on the screen.

### Compliance Check
- [ ] **Coding Standards:** To Be Verified (TBV) during code review.
- [ ] **Project Structure:** TBV. Ensure file locations match `unified-project-structure.md`.
- [ ] **Testing Strategy:** TBV. Ensure tests outlined above are implemented.
- [ ] **All ACs Met:** TBV. E2E tests should validate all acceptance criteria.

### Final Status
- **âœ“ Approved for Development** - The story is well-defined. Proceed with implementation, ensuring the test plan above is followed.
