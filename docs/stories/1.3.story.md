# Story 1.3: Display Project List

### Status
- Review

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** to see a list of all my Honeycomb projects after I connect my wallet, **so that** I can get an immediate overview of my assets.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. [cite_start]Upon successful wallet connection, the application makes a call to the BFF, which then queries the Honeycomb API's `project` endpoint, using the public key from the connected wallet as the `authority`[cite: 1483].
2. [cite_start]If the API call is successful, the dashboard displays a list of projects, showing at least the project name[cite: 1483].
3. [cite_start]If the user has no projects, a message is displayed indicating "No projects found"[cite: 1483].
4. [cite_start]If the API call fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed[cite: 1483].

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Backend (BFF):**
    - [ ] Create the Hono route handler for `GET /api/projects`.
    - [ ] Implement the handler to call the `Honeycomb API Client` service.
    - [ ] The service method should use the `edge-client` to fetch projects for the user's public key.
    - [ ] Ensure the endpoint returns the project data or a standardized error.
- [ ] **Frontend (Service Layer):**
    - [ ] Create a `projectService.ts` file to handle communication with the BFF.
    - [ ] Implement a `fetchProjects` function that calls the `GET /api/projects` endpoint.
- [ ] **Frontend (State Management):**
    - [ ] Create a `projectStore.ts` using Zustand.
    - [ ] Add state variables for `projects`, `isLoading`, and `error`.
    - [ ] Create an action that uses the `projectService` to fetch projects and update the store's state.
- [ ] **Frontend (UI Component):**
    - [ ] Create a `ProjectList.tsx` React component.
    - [ ] The component should subscribe to the `projectStore`.
    - [ ] It must correctly render the UI for loading, error, and empty states.
    - [ ] When projects are available, it must render them in a list or table format.

### Dev Notes
The developer agent must have access to the public key of the connected wallet to pass to the BFF. The BFF will then use this key as the `authority` when querying the Honeycomb API.

#### How to Interact with the Honeycomb Protocol
All on-chain interactions must follow this two-step pattern using the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`.

**1. Prepare the Transaction**
Use the client to call the appropriate method for creating a transaction. This returns a serialized transaction response.

*Example*:
```ts
const {
  createCreateProjectTransaction: { tx: txResponse },
} = await client.createCreateProjectTransaction({
  name: "My Project",
  authority: authorityPublicKey,
});
```

**2. Sign and Send the Transaction**
Use the `sendClientTransactions` helper function to prompt the user to sign and then send the transaction.

*Example*:

```ts
import { sendClientTransactions } from "@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client/client/walletHelpers";

const response = await sendClientTransactions(client, wallet, txResponse);
```

While this story only involves fetching data, this pattern is mandatory for future stories that perform "write" actions.
