# Story 3.1: Create New Resource

### **Status**
- Review

### **Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a form to define and create a new game resource,
**so that** I can establish the basic assets for my game's economy.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  On the project detail page, there is a "Create Resource" button.
2.  Clicking the button opens a form or modal with fields for Name, Symbol, Decimals, URI, and Storage type (`AccountState` or `LedgerState`).
3.  The form includes client-side validation for all required fields.
4.  Submitting the form constructs the correct payload for the `createCreateNewResourceTransaction` GraphQL mutation.
5.  The user is prompted to sign the transaction with their connected wallet.
6.  Upon successful transaction, the user sees a confirmation message, and the new resource appears in a list of project resources.
7.  If the transaction fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* **Frontend (app/client)**
    * [x] Add a "Create Resource" button to the project detail page. (AC: 1)
    * [x] Create a new reusable `Modal` component using Shadcn/ui for the form. (AC: 2)
    * [x] Build the "Create Resource" form with input fields for Name, Symbol, Decimals, URI, and a dropdown for Storage type. (AC: 2)
    * [x] Implement client-side validation for all form fields. (AC: 3)
    * [x] Create a new API service function to call the BFF's `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources` endpoint. (AC: 4)
    * [x] Implement the client-side logic to receive the serialized transaction from the BFF, request user signature via the wallet adapter, and send the signed transaction. (AC: 5)
    * [x] Add a success toast/notification and logic to refresh the project's resource list upon successful creation. (AC: 6)
    * [x] Add an error toast/notification for failed transactions. (AC: 7)
* **Backend (app/server)**
    * [x] Create a new route handler for `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources` in the Hono application. (AC: 4)
    * [x] In the route handler, call the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`'s `createCreateNewResourceTransaction` method with the parameters from the request body.
    * [x] Return the serialized transaction object to the frontend in the response. (AC: 4, 5)
    * [x] Implement error handling to catch and return any errors from the Honeycomb API. (AC: 7)

### **Dev Notes**
* The backend will act as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF), simply passing requests to the Honeycomb Protocol GraphQL API via the official `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client` library.
* The frontend will handle all transaction signing. The BFF's role is to construct the transaction, not to sign or send it.
* Shared types for the request and response bodies should be defined in the `app/shared` package to ensure type safety between the client and server.
* Frontend components should be built using the established **Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS** framework.
* Global state, such as the list of resources for the project, should be managed with **Zustand**.
