# Story 3.1: Create New Resource

### **Status**
- Done

### **Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** a form to define and create a new game resource,
**so that** I can establish the basic assets for my game's economy.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  On the project detail page, there is a "Create Resource" button.
2.  Clicking the button opens a form or modal with fields for Name, Symbol, Decimals, URI, and Storage type (`AccountState` or `LedgerState`).
3.  The form includes client-side validation for all required fields.
4.  Submitting the form constructs the correct payload for the `createCreateNewResourceTransaction` GraphQL mutation.
5.  The user is prompted to sign the transaction with their connected wallet.
6.  Upon successful transaction, the user sees a confirmation message, and the new resource appears in a list of project resources.
7.  If the transaction fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* **Frontend (app/client)**
    * [x] Add a "Create Resource" button to the project detail page. (AC: 1)
    * [x] Create a new reusable `Modal` component using Shadcn/ui for the form. (AC: 2)
    * [x] Build the "Create Resource" form with input fields for Name, Symbol, Decimals, URI, and a dropdown for Storage type. (AC: 2)
    * [x] Implement client-side validation for all form fields. (AC: 3)
    * [x] Create a new API service function to call the BFF's `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources` endpoint. (AC: 4)
    * [x] Implement the client-side logic to receive the serialized transaction from the BFF, request user signature via the wallet adapter, and send the signed transaction. (AC: 5)
    * [x] Add a success toast/notification and logic to refresh the project's resource list upon successful creation. (AC: 6)
    * [x] Add an error toast/notification for failed transactions. (AC: 7)
* **Backend (app/server)**
    * [x] Create a new route handler for `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources` in the Hono application. (AC: 4)
    * [x] In the route handler, call the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`'s `createCreateNewResourceTransaction` method with the parameters from the request body.
    * [x] Return the serialized transaction object to the frontend in the response. (AC: 4, 5)
    * [x] Implement error handling to catch and return any errors from the Honeycomb API. (AC: 7)

### **Dev Notes**
* The backend will act as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF), simply passing requests to the Honeycomb Protocol GraphQL API via the official `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client` library.
* The frontend will handle all transaction signing. The BFF's role is to construct the transaction, not to sign or send it.
* Shared types for the request and response bodies should be defined in the `app/shared` package to ensure type safety between the client and server.
* Frontend components should be built using the established **Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS** framework.
* Global state, such as the list of resources for the project, should be managed with **Zustand**.

### **QA Results**
**Review Date:** 2025-07-23

**Overall Assessment:**
The story is functionally implemented according to the acceptance criteria. The code structure and adherence to specified frameworks (Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, shared types) are good.

**Detailed Findings:**

*   **Frontend (`app/client`):**
    *   **AC: 1 (Create Resource Button):** Implemented correctly in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx`.
    *   **AC: 2 (Form/Modal):** `CreateResourceModal.tsx` uses Shadcn/ui components and includes all required fields.
    *   **AC: 3 (Client-side Validation):** Implemented in `CreateResourceModal.tsx` for all required fields, including non-negative check for decimals.
    *   **AC: 4 (Payload Construction):** `CreateResourceModal.tsx` calls `resourceService.ts` with the correct data.
    *   **AC: 5 (Wallet Signing):** `CreateResourceModal.tsx` correctly uses `sendClientTransactions` for signing.
    *   **AC: 6 (Success Message):** Success toast is displayed in `CreateResourceModal.tsx`.
    *   **AC: 7 (Error Message):** Error toast is displayed in `CreateResourceModal.tsx`.
    *   **Minor Issue:** `TODO` comments exist in `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` and `CreateResourceModal.tsx` for refreshing the resource list after successful creation. This is a functional gap for a complete UX.
    *   **Minor Issue:** `API_URL` is hardcoded in `resourceService.ts` with a `TODO` to make it configurable.

*   **Backend (`app/server`):**
    *   **AC: 4 (Route Handler & Mutation Call):** `index.ts` has the correct route handler and calls `createCreateNewResourceTransaction` with appropriate parameters.
    *   **AC: 5 (Return Serialized Transaction):** `index.ts` correctly returns the `tx` object.
    *   **AC: 7 (Error Handling):** Error handling is implemented in `index.ts` for the new route.
    *   **Minor Issue:** `console.log` statements are present in `app/server/src/index.ts` which should be removed for production.

*   **Shared (`app/shared`):**
    *   Type definitions (`CreateResourceRequest`, `CreateResourceResponse`, `Resource`) are correctly defined and used, ensuring type safety.

**Recommendations for Future Work/Improvements:**

1.  **Implement Resource List Refresh:** Address the `TODO` comments in the frontend to refresh the resource list after a successful creation.
2.  **Configure API URL:** Externalize the `API_URL` in `resourceService.ts` using environment variables.
3.  **Remove Console Logs:** Clean up `console.log` statements in the backend.
4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Develop comprehensive unit tests for both frontend components (especially form validation and service integration) and backend route handlers to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
5.  **Enhance Error Messages:** Review and refine error messages to be more specific and user-friendly for all potential failure scenarios.

**Status:**
Ready for further testing and integration, with noted minor issues and recommendations for future improvements.
