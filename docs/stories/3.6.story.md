# Story 3.6: Create Character Tree

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a character tree for my character model,
**so that** I have a dedicated on-chain store for all characters minted from that model.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  After a `CharacterModel` is successfully created, the UI presents an option to "Create Character Tree".
2.  Clicking the button initiates the `createCreateCharactersTreeTransaction` process.
3.  The user signs the transaction and receives success or failure feedback.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Frontend:** In the Character Models list/view, add a "Create Character Tree" button for each model that does not yet have one.
-   [ ] **Frontend:** Create a new modal/form component for the `treeConfig` inputs at `app/client/src/features/asset-management/components/CreateCharacterTreeForm.tsx`.
    -   [ ] This form should allow the user to select either a "Basic" (with `numAssets` input) or "Advanced" (with `maxDepth`, `maxBufferSize`, `canopyDepth` inputs) configuration. This UI can be reused/adapted from the Assembler Config story.
-   [ ] **Backend (BFF):** Add a new route handler for `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/character-models/{modelId}/tree` to the existing file at `app/server/src/routes/characterModels.ts`.
    -   [ ] The endpoint should accept a `treeConfig` object in the request body.
    -   [ ] Implement server-side validation for the `treeConfig` payload.
    -   [ ] The handler should call the `createCreateCharactersTreeTransaction` method from the Honeycomb API Client, passing the `modelId` from the URL.
-   [ ] **Frontend:** Implement the logic to open the form, call the new BFF endpoint on submission, and handle the transaction signing flow.
    -   [ ] Display a success notification, including the returned `treeAddress`, or an error message.
    -   [ ] After successful creation, the "Create Character Tree" button for that model should be hidden or disabled.

## Dev Notes

-   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/character-models/{modelId}/tree`
-   **New Frontend Component Location:** `app/client/src/features/asset-management/components/CreateCharacterTreeForm.tsx`
-   **Backend Route Location:** Add the new route to the existing `app/server/src/routes/characterModels.ts`.
-   **Honeycomb Mutation:** The BFF will use `createCreateCharactersTreeTransaction`.
-   **Payload Fields:**
    * **Required:** `project` (from URL), `characterModel` (from URL), `authority`, `treeConfig`.
    * **Optional:** `payer` (defaults to authority), `lutAddresses`, `computeUnitPrice`.
-   **`treeConfig` Details:** This object requires providing *either* the `basic` or `advanced` configuration.
    * `basic`: `{ "numAssets": <number> }`
    * `advanced`: `{ "maxDepth": <number>, "maxBufferSize": <number>, "canopyDepth": <number> }`
-   **Success Response:** A successful transaction will return a `treeAddress`. This should be displayed to the user as confirmation.

## Testing

-   **Unit Test (Frontend):** Verify the `treeConfig` form component can be opened and correctly captures both basic and advanced inputs.
-   **Unit Test (Backend):** Verify the BFF endpoint correctly calls the Honeycomb mutation with parameters from the URL (`projectId`, `modelId`) and the request body (`treeConfig`).
-   **Integration Test:** Test the full flow of clicking the button, filling out the form, signing the transaction, and receiving a success message with the new tree address.
-   **Validation:** Confirm that the UI updates correctly after a tree is created (e.g., the button is disabled).
