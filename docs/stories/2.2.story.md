# Story 2.2: Display User and Profile List

### Status
- Approved

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** to see a list of all users and their profiles for the selected project, **so that** I can see who is playing my game.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. When the project detail page loads, a GraphQL query is made to the Honeycomb API's `profile` endpoint, filtering by the `project` address from the URL.
2. The returned data is displayed in a table or list format.
3. The table displays key profile information, such as User ID, a truncated Profile Address, and any available `info` (name, pfp).
4. If a project has no user profiles, a message like "No profiles found for this project" is displayed.
5. If the API call fails, a user-friendly error message is shown.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Backend (BFF):**
    - [ ] Create a new Hono route handler for `GET /api/projects/:projectAddress/profiles`.
    - [ ] The handler must extract the `projectAddress` from the URL parameters.
    - [ ] The handler should call the `Honeycomb API Client` to fetch the profiles.
- [ ] **Backend (Honeycomb Client Service):**
    - [ ] Implement a `getProfilesForProject` function that uses the **`edge-client`'s `findProfiles` method**, filtering by the provided `projectAddress`.
- [ ] **Frontend (Service Layer):**
    - [ ] Create a `profileService.ts` file.
    - [ ] Implement a `fetchProfilesByProject` function that calls the new BFF endpoint.
- [ ] **Frontend (State Management):**
    - [ ] Create a `profileStore.ts` using Zustand to manage the state for profiles.
    - [ ] Implement an action to fetch and store the list of profiles for the current project.
- [ ] **Frontend (UI Component):**
    - [ ] Create a `ProfileList.tsx` component that displays the profiles in a table.
    - [ ] The `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` should use the `profileStore` to fetch the data when it loads.
    - [ ] The `ProfileList.tsx` component must correctly render UI for loading, error, and empty (no profiles) states.

### Dev Notes
This story populates the placeholder area created in the `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` from Story 2.1. The BFF needs to expose a new endpoint that accepts a project address and returns a list of profiles.

The backend service will use the `client.findProfiles()` method from the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`. The call will look similar to this, filtering by the `projects` argument:

```javascript
const { profile: profiles } = await client.findProfiles({
  projects: [projectAddress],
});
```

The frontend should use the `HoneycombProfile` interface from the `app/shared` package to correctly type the response data.
