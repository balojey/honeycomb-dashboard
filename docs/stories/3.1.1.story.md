# Story 3.1.1: Create Resource Tree

### **Status**
- Done

### **Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a resource tree for my `LedgerState` resource,
**so that** I can store its ownership and usage information on-chain.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  After successfully creating a resource with `storage` type `LedgerState`, the UI presents a clear option to "Create Resource Tree".
2.  Resources of type `AccountState` do not display this option.
3.  Clicking the "Create Resource Tree" button initiates the `createCreateNewResourceTreeTransaction` process via the BFF.
4.  The user is prompted by their connected wallet to sign and approve the creation transaction.
5.  Upon successful confirmation of the transaction, the user sees a success message.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* **Frontend (app/client)**
    * [x] In the Resource Management UI, conditionally render a "Create Resource Tree" button or action item for resources where `storage.kind` is `LedgerState`. (AC: 1, 2)
    * [x] Create a new API service function to call the BFF's `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources/{resourceId}/tree` endpoint. (AC: 3)
    * [x] Implement the client-side logic to handle the transaction signing flow for creating the resource tree. (AC: 4)
    * [x] Display a success toast/notification when the transaction is confirmed. (AC: 5)
    * [x] Display an error toast/notification if the process fails.
* **Backend (app/server)**
    * [x] Create the new route handler for `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources/{resourceId}/tree`. (AC: 3)
    * [x] In the handler, call the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`'s `createCreateNewResourceTreeTransaction` method, passing the relevant parameters.
    * [x] Return the serialized transaction object from the Honeycomb client to the frontend.
    * [x] Implement standard error handling.

### **Dev Notes**
* **Conditional UI**: The primary frontend task is to implement conditional logic. The "Create Resource Tree" action must *only* be available for `LedgerState` resources. This is a critical path to prevent user confusion and unnecessary actions for `AccountState` resources.
* **API Endpoint**: This story implements the new `/tree` endpoint defined in the updated `architecture.md`.
* **Honeycomb Client**: The specific backend method to use is `createCreateNewResourceTreeTransaction`.

### **Testing**
* **Frontend**:
    * Write a component test to verify that the "Create Resource Tree" button is correctly rendered for `LedgerState` resources and hidden for `AccountState` resources.
* **Backend**:
    * Write an integration test for the new `/tree` endpoint, mocking the Honeycomb client to ensure it is called correctly.
