# Story 3.5: Create Character Model

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a form to define a new character model,
**so that** I can set up the templates for in-game characters or NFTs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  On the project detail page, there is a "Create Character Model" button.
2.  The form allows the user to select a configuration `kind`: "Wrapped" or "Assembled".
3.  If "Wrapped" is selected, the form provides fields to define the `criterias` for wrapping (e.g., by Merkle Tree, Collection, or Creator).
4.  If "Assembled" is selected, the form provides fields to input the `assemblerConfigInput`, referencing an existing Assembler Config.
5.  Submitting the form uses the `createCreateCharacterModelTransaction` GraphQL mutation with the correct payload.
6.  The user is prompted to sign the transaction, and appropriate success/error feedback is provided.

## Tasks / Subtasks

-   [ ] **Frontend:** Create the "Create Character Model" form component at `app/client/src/features/asset-management/components/CreateCharacterModelForm.tsx`.
    -   [ ] Implement a radio button or select input for the `kind` ("Wrapped" or "Assembled").
    -   [ ] Based on the `kind` selection, conditionally render the appropriate set of form fields.
    -   [ ] **For "Wrapped":** Create inputs to define an array of `criterias`, where each criterion has a `kind` (e.g., "MerkleTree") and `params` (the address).
    -   [ ] **For "Assembled":** Create inputs for all fields within `assemblerConfigInput` (e.g., `assemblerConfig` address, `collectionName`, `name`, `symbol`, etc.).
    -   [ ] Implement client-side validation for all fields.
-   [ ] **Backend (BFF):** Create a new API endpoint `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/character-models` in a new file at `app/server/src/routes/characterModels.ts`.
    -   [ ] The endpoint should accept the entire `CharacterConfigInput` payload.
    -   [ ] Implement server-side validation for the payload, accounting for the different structures of "Wrapped" vs. "Assembled".
    -   [ ] The handler should call the `createCreateCharacterModelTransaction` method.
    -   [ ] Return the serialized transaction to the frontend.
-   [ ] **Frontend:** Implement form submission logic.
    -   [ ] Construct the correct nested `config` object based on the user's selections.
    -   [ ] Send the payload to the new BFF endpoint.
    -   [ ] Handle the transaction signing flow.
    -   [ ] On success, refresh the list of Character Models.

## Dev Notes

-   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/character-models`
-   **New Frontend Component Location:** `app/client/src/features/asset-management/components/CreateCharacterModelForm.tsx`
-   **New Backend Route Location:** `app/server/src/routes/characterModels.ts`
-   **Honeycomb Mutation:** The BFF will use `createCreateCharacterModelTransaction`.
-   **Payload Structure:** The core of the payload is the `config` object, which has two main variants determined by the `kind` field. Only one variant's data should be provided.
    * **Required Fields:** `project`, `authority`, `config`.
    * **Optional Fields:** `payer`, `attributes`, `lutAddresses`, `computeUnitPrice`.
-   **Example BFF Payload (`Wrapped`):**
    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        "kind": "Wrapped",
        "criterias": [
          {
            "kind": "MerkleTree",
            "params": "..." // Merkle Tree Address
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
-   **Example BFF Payload (`Assembled`):**
    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        "kind": "Assembled",
        "assemblerConfigInput": {
          "assemblerConfig": "...", // Assembler Config Address
          "collectionName": "My Assembled Collection",
          "name": "Assembled Character #1",
          "symbol": "AC1",
          "description": "A character assembled via the dashboard.",
          "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500, // Represents 5%
          "creators": [
            {
              "address": "...", // Wallet Address
              "share": 100
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Testing

-   **Unit Test (Frontend):** Verify the form correctly renders conditional fields based on the "Wrapped"/"Assembled" selection.
-   **Unit Test (Backend):** Write separate tests to validate both "Wrapped" and "Assembled" payload structures.
-   **Integration Test:** Create one test for the "Wrapped" flow and a separate test for the "Assembled" flow, from form submission to transaction confirmation.
-   **Validation:** Confirm that after a successful transaction, the new Character Model appears in the project's asset list with the correct `kind`.
-   **Error Handling:** Test submitting a payload with data for both "Wrapped" and "Assembled" to ensure the BFF rejects it.
