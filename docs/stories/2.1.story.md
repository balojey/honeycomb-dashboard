# Story 2.1: Project Navigation

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** to click on a project from my project list and be taken to a dedicated project detail page, **so that** I can access management features for that specific project.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Each project in the list (from Story 1.3) is a clickable link.
2. Clicking a project link navigates the user to a new view/page (e.g., `/project/{projectAddress}`).
3. The new page clearly displays the name of the selected project as a title.
4. The page contains a designated area for displaying the list of users and profiles (to be implemented in Story 2.2).

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Frontend (Routing):**
    - [x] Configure a new dynamic route in `react-router-dom` for `/project/:projectAddress` that renders a `ProjectDetailPage` component.
- [x] **Frontend (UI - Project List):**
    - [x] Modify the `ProjectList.tsx` component.
    - [x] Wrap each project item with a `<Link>` component from `react-router-dom` pointing to the correct dynamic URL.
- [x] **Frontend (UI - Project Detail Page):**
    - [x] Create the new `ProjectDetailPage.tsx` component file.
    - [x] The component must use the `useParams` hook to read the `projectAddress` from the URL.
    - [x] It should retrieve the project's name (e.g., from the `projectStore`) and display it as a prominent title.
    - [x] Lay out the basic structure of the page, including a placeholder for the user/profile list.

### QA Results
- **2025-07-23:**
  - All acceptance criteria met.
  - Routing implemented correctly.
  - Project detail page displays correctly.
  - Fixed linting errors (`no-explicit-any`) in `ProjectList.tsx` and `projectService.ts`.
  - Fixed `exhaustive-deps` warning in `App.tsx`.
  - Code is approved and ready for production.

### Dev Notes
This story builds directly upon the `ProjectList.tsx` component created in Story 1.3. The primary task is to introduce client-side routing to create a master-detail pattern for projects.

The new `ProjectDetailPage` will serve as the main layout for all project-specific management features. According to the UI/UX Specification, this page should be designed to eventually hold a tabbed navigation for "Users & Profiles," "Resource Management," etc. This story should implement the main page shell and title.
