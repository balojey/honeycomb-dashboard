# Story 1.2: Implement Social Login

**Status**: Approved

**Story**:
As a new user, I want to sign up or log in using my Google account, so that I can access the dashboard without needing a pre-existing Solana wallet.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The main page displays "Login with Google" and other social provider buttons.
2. Clicking a social login button initiates the authentication flow with the chosen account abstraction SDK (e.g., Crossmint).
3. After successful social authentication, the SDK creates an embedded wallet for the user.
4. The application displays the user's email or social handle, indicating they are logged in.
5. The application has access to the user's underlying Solana public key for making API calls.

**Dev Notes**:

*   **Previous Story Insights**: The initial project scaffolding is complete and stable.
*   **Data Models**: 
    *   `HoneycombUser` and `HoneycombProfile` will be relevant for managing user data post-login. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
*   **API Specifications**: No new BFF endpoints are required for this story. The frontend will interact directly with the Crossmint SDK.
*   **Component Specifications**: 
    *   A new `Authentication` component will be needed to house the login buttons and manage the authentication state. [Source: architecture/components.md]
*   **File Locations**: 
    *   Create a new feature directory `app/client/src/features/auth` for the new authentication components. [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
    *   The `AuthenticationService` will be implemented in `app/client/src/services/auth.ts`. [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
*   **Testing Requirements**: 
    *   Unit tests should be written for the `Authentication` component to ensure the login buttons render correctly. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
    *   Mock the Crossmint SDK to test the authentication flow without making actual API calls. [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
*   **Technical Constraints**: 
    *   Use the Crossmint SDK for account abstraction and embedded wallets. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
    *   Manage global authentication state using Zustand. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Tasks / Subtasks**:

*   Task 1 (AC: 1): Create a new `Login` component in `app/client/src/features/auth` that displays social login buttons.
*   Task 2 (AC: 2): Implement the `AuthenticationService` in `app/client/src/services/auth.ts` to handle the Crossmint authentication flow.
*   Task 3 (AC: 3, 4): Integrate the `AuthenticationService` with the `Login` component to trigger the login process and update the UI with the user's information upon successful authentication.
*   Task 4: Store the user's authentication status and public key in a global Zustand store.
<!-- *   Task 5: Write unit tests for the `Login` component. -->
