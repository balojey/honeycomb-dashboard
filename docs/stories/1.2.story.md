# Story 1.2: Implement Wallet Login

**Status**: Review

**Story**:
As a user, I want to see a "Connect Wallet" button and a wallet connection modal, so that I can authenticate with the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The main page displays a "Connect Wallet" button when no wallet is connected.
2. Clicking the button opens a Solana wallet adapter modal listing compatible wallets.
3. Selecting a wallet and approving the connection successfully connects the wallet to the application.
4. Once connected, the button's text changes to show the user's truncated wallet address.
5. The application stores the connected wallet state for use in subsequent API calls.

**Dev Notes**:

*   **Previous Story Insights**: The initial project structure is in place.
*   **Data Models**: No new data models are required for this story. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
*   **API Specifications**: No backend API changes are required. This is a frontend-only story.
*   **Component Specifications**: 
    *   An **Authentication Service** on the frontend will manage the wallet connection using the Solana Wallet Adapter. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
*   **File Locations**: 
    *   The new authentication service should be created in `app/client/src/services/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
    *   The "Connect Wallet" button and related UI components will be in `app/client/src/components/`. [Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
*   **Testing Requirements**: 
    *   Unit tests should be written for the authentication service to mock wallet connection states. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
    *   Component tests should verify the button's state changes. [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
*   **Technical Constraints**:
    *   Use the **Solana Wallet Adapter** library for wallet interactions. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Tasks / Subtasks**:

*   Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Install and configure the Solana Wallet Adapter library in the `app/client` project.
*   Task 2 (AC: 1, 2): Create a `WalletProvider` component that wraps the main application and provides wallet context.
*   Task 3 (AC: 1): Create a "Connect Wallet" button component.
*   Task 4 (AC: 2): Implement the logic to show the wallet adapter modal when the button is clicked.
*   Task 5 (AC: 4): Update the UI to display the truncated wallet address when connected.
*   Task 6 (AC: 5): Implement the authentication service in `app/client/src/services/` that provides the rest of the application with the connected wallet's information.
<!-- *   Task 7: Write unit tests for the Zustand store and the authentication service. -->
<!-- *   Task 8: Write component tests for the "Connect Wallet" button. -->
