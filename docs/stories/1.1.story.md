# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding

**Status**: Approved

**Story**:
As a developer, I want the initial monorepo structure with frontend and backend applications set up, so that I have a clean, organized foundation to start building features on.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A monorepo using Bun Workspaces is created.
2. A new React + Vite application is scaffolded in the `apps/web` directory.
3. A new Hono application is scaffolded in the `apps/api` directory.
4. Shared TypeScript configuration is set up for the workspace.
5. The developer can run both the frontend and backend applications with a single command from the root.
