## **User Story: Refactor Project View for Separation of Concerns**

### **Story**

**As a** developer using the dashboard,
**I want** to manage Users, Resources, and Character Models on separate, dedicated pages within a project,
**so that** the interface is less cluttered, more intuitive, and easier to navigate.

### **Background**

[cite_start]Currently, the Project Detail Page displays all users, resources, and character models in a single view[cite: 2, 3]. This creates a dense and potentially confusing interface as more assets are added to a project. [cite_start]This refactor will improve usability by giving each core entity its own dedicated management area, aligning the frontend structure with the already-separated backend API endpoints[cite: 1, 2].

### **Acceptance Criteria**

1.  When a user navigates to a project (`/project/{projectId}`), the main view must contain a primary navigation element (e.g., a Tab group from Shadcn/ui) with links for "Users & Profiles," "Resources," and "Character Models."
2.  [cite_start]The "Users & Profiles" tab/link must navigate to a dedicated view at `/project/{projectId}/users` that displays **only** the user and profile list from the existing implementation[cite: 3].
3.  The "Resources" tab/link must navigate to a dedicated view at `/project/{projectId}/resources`. [cite_start]This page must contain the UI for listing existing resources and the "Create Resource" button[cite: 2].
4.  The "Character Models" tab/link must navigate to a dedicated view at `/project/{projectId}/characters`. [cite_start]This page must contain the UI for listing existing character models and the "Create Character Model" button[cite: 2].
5.  The default view when navigating to `/project/{projectId}` should redirect to one of the new sub-pages (e.g., `/project/{projectId}/users`).
6.  All routing must be handled client-side using `react-router-dom` nested routes.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**

-   **Refactor Routing:**
    -   [x] Update the `react-router-dom` configuration to support nested routes under `/project/:projectId`, including `/users`, `/resources`, and `/characters`.
-   **Create Layout Component:**
    -   [x] Modify the existing `ProjectPage` component to act as a layout shell.
    -   [x] Implement the new Tab navigation component within this shell. The tabs should link to the new nested routes.
-   **Create Child Page Components:**
    -   [x] Create three new page components: `UserListPage`, `ResourceListPage`, and `CharacterModelListPage`.
-   **Migrate Existing Functionality:**
    -   [x] Move the logic for fetching and displaying the user/profile list from the old `ProjectPage` into `UserListPage`[cite: 3].
    -   [x] Move the logic for fetching/displaying resources and the "Create Resource" functionality into `ResourceListPage`[cite: 2].
    -   [x] Move the logic for fetching/displaying character models and the "Create Character Model" functionality into `CharacterModelListPage`[cite: 2].

### **Developer Notes**

-   This is a **purely frontend refactoring task**. [cite_start]No backend changes are required as the API is already structured appropriately[cite: 1, 2].
-   The primary goal is to improve UX by reorganizing existing components and logic into a tabbed or sub-navigation interface.
-   [cite_start]Use the project's designated component library (**Shadcn/ui**) for the navigation element to maintain visual consistency[cite: 1].
