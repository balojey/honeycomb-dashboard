# Story 1.4: Create New Project

### Status
- Approved

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** a "Create Project" button and a form to provide a project name, **so that** I can initialize a new project on the Honeycomb Protocol.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Projects Dashboard displays a "Create New Project" button.
2. Clicking the button opens a form or modal prompting for a "Project Name".
3. The form includes client-side validation for the name field (e.g., must not be empty).
4. Submitting the form initiates the `createCreateProjectTransaction` process via the BFF.
5. The user is prompted by their connected wallet to sign and approve the creation transaction.
6. Upon successful confirmation, the project list is refreshed to show the newly created project.
7. If the transaction fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Frontend (UI Component):**
    - [ ] Add a "Create New Project" button to the main project dashboard view.
    - [ ] Create a `CreateProjectModal.tsx` component that contains a form with an input for the project name and a submit button.
    - [ ] Implement state management and validation for the form.
    - [ ] On form submission, call the `createProject` function from the project service.
- [ ] **Frontend (Service Layer):**
    - [ ] Add a `createProject` function to `projectService.ts`.
    - [ ] This function will make a `POST` request to the `/api/projects` BFF endpoint with the new project's name.
    - [ ] It will take the serialized transaction from the BFF's response and use the `sendClientTransactions` helper to prompt the user to sign and send it.
- [ ] **Backend (BFF):**
    - [ ] Create a new Hono route handler for `POST /api/projects`.
    - [ ] The handler should extract the `name` from the request body and the user's public key from the auth context.
    - [ ] It should call a new service function in the Honeycomb API Client to prepare the transaction.
    - [ ] The handler must return the serialized transaction response to the frontend.
- [ ] **Frontend (State Management):**
    - [ ] In the `projectStore.ts`, ensure there's a way to trigger a refresh of the project list.
    - [ ] After the `createProject` service call succeeds, call the refresh action to update the UI with the new project.

### Dev Notes
This is the first "write" action for the application. The developer agent must follow the established two-step pattern for on-chain transactions.

#### How to Interact with the Honeycomb Protocol
All on-chain interactions must follow this two-step pattern using the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`.

**1. Prepare the Transaction**
Use the client to call the appropriate method for creating a transaction. [cite_start]In this case, the BFF should call `client.createCreateProjectTransaction`. [cite: 5]

*Example*:
```javascript
const {
  createCreateProjectTransaction: { tx: txResponse },
} = await client.createCreateProjectTransaction({
  name: "The New Project Name",
  authority: userPublicKey,
  payer: userPublicKey, // The user will pay for the transaction
});
```

**2. Sign and Send the Transaction**
[cite\_start]The frontend will receive the `txResponse` from the BFF and use the `sendClientTransactions` helper function to get it signed and sent. [cite: 1]

*Example*:

```javascript
import { sendClientTransactions } from "@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client/client/walletHelpers";

const response = await sendClientTransactions(client, wallet, txResponse);
```
