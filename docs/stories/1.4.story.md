# Story 1.4: Create New Project

### Status
- Done

### Story
**As a** user, **I want** a "Create Project" button and a form to provide a project name, **so that** I can initialize a new project on the Honeycomb Protocol.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. The Projects Dashboard displays a "Create New Project" button.
2. Clicking the button opens a form or modal prompting for a "Project Name".
3. The form includes client-side validation for the name field (e.g., must not be empty).
4. Submitting the form initiates the `createCreateProjectTransaction` process via the BFF.
5. The user is prompted by their connected wallet to sign and approve the creation transaction.
6. Upon successful confirmation, the project list is refreshed to show the newly created project.
7. If the transaction fails, a user-friendly error message is displayed.

### Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Frontend (UI Component):**
    - [x] Add a "Create New Project" button to the main project dashboard view.
    - [x] Create a `CreateProjectModal.tsx` component that contains a form with an input for the project name and a submit button.
    - [x] Implement state management and validation for the form.
    - [x] On form submission, call the `createProject` function from the project service.
- [x] **Frontend (Service Layer):**
    - [x] Add a `createProject` function to `projectService.ts`.
    - [x] This function will make a `POST` request to the `/api/projects` BFF endpoint with the new project's name.
    - [x] It will take the serialized transaction from the BFF's response and use the `sendClientTransactions` helper to prompt the user to sign and send it.
- [x] **Backend (BFF):**
    - [x] Create a new Hono route handler for `POST /api/projects`.
    - [x] The handler should extract the `name` from the request body and the user's public key from the auth context.
    - [x] It should call a new service function in the Honeycomb API Client to prepare the transaction.
    - [x] The handler must return the serialized transaction response to the frontend.
- [x] **Frontend (State Management):**
    - [x] In the `projectStore.ts`, ensure there's a way to trigger a refresh of the project list.
    - [x] After the `createProject` service call succeeds, call the refresh action to update the UI with the new project.

### Dev Notes
This is the first "write" action for the application. The developer agent must follow the established two-step pattern for on-chain transactions.

### Dev Agent Record
- **Agent Model Used**: Gemini
- **Debug Log References**:
  - Initial file search for `App.tsx` and `ProjectList.tsx`.
  - Reading `App.tsx` and `ProjectList.tsx` to understand UI structure.
  - Reading `CreateProjectModal.tsx` to verify existing implementation.
  - Searching for `projectService.ts`.
  - Reading `projectService.ts` to add `createProject` function.
  - Searching for `EdgeClient` instantiation in client-side code.
  - Reading `WalletProvider.tsx`.
  - Modifying `App.tsx` to instantiate and pass `EdgeClient`.
  - Modifying `ProjectList.tsx` to use `createProject` and handle errors/refresh.
  - Searching for main Hono app file in `app/server/src`.
  - Reading `index.ts` (Hono app) and `honeycomb-client.ts`.
  - Modifying `honeycomb-client.ts` to add `createCreateProjectTransaction`.
  - Modifying `index.ts` to add `POST /api/projects` route and import `createCreateProjectTransaction`.
- **Completion Notes List**:
  - Frontend UI components for project creation (button, modal, form, validation) are implemented.
  - Frontend service layer (`projectService.ts`) now includes `createProject` for interacting with the BFF and handling wallet transactions.
  - Backend BFF (`index.ts`) has a new `POST /api/projects` route to prepare the on-chain transaction using the Honeycomb API Client.
  - The `EdgeClient` is instantiated in `App.tsx` and passed down to `ProjectList.tsx`.
  - Project list refresh is triggered upon successful project creation.
- **File List**:
  - `app/client/src/App.tsx`
  - `app/client/src/components/ProjectList.tsx`
  - `app/client/src/components/CreateProjectModal.tsx`
  - `app/client/src/services/projectService.ts`
  - `app/server/src/index.ts`
  - `app/server/src/honeycomb-client.ts`
- **Change Log**:
  - Added `useMemo` and `useConnection` to `App.tsx` to instantiate `EdgeClient` and pass it as a prop to `ProjectList`.
  - Modified `ProjectList.tsx` to accept `client` prop, import `createProject`, call `createProject` in `handleCreateProject`, and add error handling and project list refresh.
  - Added `createProject` function to `projectService.ts` to handle the `POST` request to BFF and `sendClientTransactions`.
  - Added `createCreateProjectTransaction` function to `honeycomb-client.ts` to prepare the transaction using `client.createCreateProjectTransaction`.
  - Added `POST /api/projects` route handler to `index.ts` to extract project name and authority, call `createCreateProjectTransaction`, and return the serialized transaction.
  - Imported `createCreateProjectTransaction` in `index.ts`.

#### How to Interact with the Honeycomb Protocol
All on-chain interactions must follow this two-step pattern using the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`.

**1. Prepare the Transaction**
Use the client to call the appropriate method for creating a transaction. [cite_start]In this case, the BFF should call `client.createCreateProjectTransaction`. [cite: 5]

*Example*:
```javascript
const {
  createCreateProjectTransaction: { tx: txResponse },
} = await client.createCreateProjectTransaction({
  name: "The New Project Name",
  authority: userPublicKey,
  payer: userPublicKey, // The user will pay for the transaction
});
```

**2. Sign and Send the Transaction**
[cite\_start]The frontend will receive the `txResponse` from the BFF and use the `sendClientTransactions` helper function to get it signed and sent. [cite: 1]

*Example*:

```javascript
import { sendClientTransactions } from "@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client/client/walletHelpers";

const response = await sendClientTransactions(client, wallet, txResponse);
```

### QA Results
- **Verdict**: Needs Rework
- **Reviewed By**: Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)
- **Date**: 2025-07-23

#### Assessment:
- **Functionality**: The core feature has been implemented correctly according to the acceptance criteria. The two-step transaction process (BFF preparation, client-side signing) is followed, and the UI components are functional.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-structured, and follows project conventions. The separation between client, server, and shared code is good.

#### Required Changes:
1.  **CRITICAL: Lack of Automated Tests.** This feature involves user input, API interaction, and an on-chain transaction. It is essential to have a comprehensive test suite. The developer agent must add the following:
    -   **Component Tests (Client):**
        -   A test for `CreateProjectModal.tsx` to verify that it renders correctly, validates input, and calls the `onSubmit` prop.
        -   A test for `ProjectList.tsx` that mocks the `projectService` and `wallet` to verify that the "Create New Project" button works, the modal opens, and the `handleCreateProject` function behaves as expected on success and failure.
    -   **Service Tests (Client):**
        -   A test for `projectService.ts` that mocks the `fetch` API to ensure it correctly calls the BFF endpoint and handles both successful and error responses from the `createProject` function.
    -   **Integration Tests (BFF):**
        -   An integration test for the `POST /api/projects` endpoint in `app/server/src/index.ts`. This test should use a tool like `supertest` to make a request to the endpoint and mock the `honeycomb-client` to ensure the handler correctly processes valid and invalid requests.

#### Action:
- The story is being returned to the developer to implement the required test coverage. Once the tests are in place and passing, the story can be resubmitted for QA review.
