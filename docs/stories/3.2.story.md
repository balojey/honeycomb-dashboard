# Story 3.2: Mint Resource

### **Status**
- Ready for Review

### **Story**
**As a** developer,
**I want** to mint a specific amount of a created resource to a user's wallet,
**so that** I can distribute assets or rewards to my players.

### **Acceptance Criteria**
1.  Each resource in the project's resource list has a "Mint" action/button.
2.  Clicking "Mint" opens a modal prompting for an `amount` and a recipient `owner` wallet address.
3.  The form validates that the amount is a valid number and the owner is a valid Solana public key.
4.  Submitting the form uses the `createMintResourceTransaction` GraphQL mutation.
5.  The user is prompted to sign the transaction.
6.  Upon successful transaction, a confirmation message is displayed.

### **Tasks / Subtasks**
* **Frontend (app/client)**
    * [x] In the Resource Management UI, add a "Mint" button to each resource item in the list. (AC: 1)
    * [x] Create a "Mint Resource" modal, reusing the `Modal` component, that contains a form for `amount` and `owner` wallet address. (AC: 2)
    * [x] Implement client-side validation for the form fields, ensuring `amount` is a number and `owner` is a valid Solana public key. (AC: 3)
    * [x] Create a new API service function to call the BFF's `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources/{resourceId}/mint` endpoint. (AC: 4)
    * [x] Implement the client-side logic to handle the transaction signing flow using the wallet adapter. (AC: 5)
    * [x] Display a success toast/notification upon successful transaction confirmation. (AC: 6)
    * [x] Display an error toast/notification if the minting process fails.
* **Backend (app/server)**
    * [x] Create a new route handler for `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/resources/{resourceId}/mint` in the Hono application. (AC: 4)
    * [x] In the handler, call the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client`'s `createMintResourceTransaction` method.
    * [x] Pass the `resourceId` from the URL parameters and the `amount` and `owner` from the request body to the Honeycomb client method.
    * [x] Return the serialized transaction object provided by the Honeycomb client to the frontend.
    * [x] Implement error handling for the API call to the Honeycomb Protocol.

### **Dev Notes**
* This story follows the established pattern: the React frontend initiates a request to the Hono BFF, which then calls the Honeycomb Protocol API via the `@honeycomb-protocol/edge-client` to construct a transaction.
* The BFF's role is solely to create the transaction; all signing is handled on the client-side by the user's wallet adapter.
* The frontend form must include robust validation for the recipient wallet address to ensure it's a valid Solana public key before sending the request to the backend. This prevents unnecessary API calls with invalid data.
* The specific Honeycomb client method to be used in the BFF is `createMintResourceTransaction`.
